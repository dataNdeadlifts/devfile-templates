# Devfile Templates

A set of personal [devfile](devfile.io) templates I use with [Eclispe Che](https://github.com/eclipse/che) (i.e. [OpenShift Dev Spaces](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-dev-spaces/overview)).

## Usage

You can do any of the following:

- Copy the contents to your projects and open in Eclipse Che
- Source the file as a parent in your own devfile
```
```
